# `scrape-itch-io-bundle`

View the scrape at this [Google Sheets][] or at the repo's [CSV][].

This repo is a very quick and dirty hack to scrape the contents of itch.io's
[Bundle for Ukraine](https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine). itch.io's
interface isn't really built for filtering the list of games in the bundle, so
this project scrapes out all the games and spits out a CSV. Note that the code
in this repo is in the public domain and it is unlikely it will be supported.
Hopefully no one needs to run the code anyways, considering the CSV is included
in this repo. 🙏
